### 4. Learning Styles Diversity

- **Learning Channels:** Auditory (40), Mixed (38), Kinesthetic (6), Visual (10)
- **Grouping Preferences:** Small group (47), Pair work (32), Individual (15)
- **Movement Needs:** Most don't need movement (88), few require it (3)

### 5. Curricular States Overview

Students show varied progress across curriculum topics, with most having:
- Some topics "conseguido" (achieved)
- Others "en proceso" (in progress)
- Some "superado" (exceeded expectations)
- This creates natural opportunities for differentiated instruction

## Selected Pilot Classroom (25 Students)

### Selection Strategy

I used stratified sampling to ensure maximum diversity:

1. **All 3 double exceptionality students** (rare, high diversity value)
2. **5 low performers** (academic average ≤ 2.5)
3. **11 mid performers** (academic average 2.6-3.5)
4. **6 high performers** (academic average ≥ 3.6)

### Pilot Classroom Characteristics

**Academic Diversity:**
- Range: 2.2 - 5.0 (out of 5)
- Mean: 3.3
- Represents all performance levels

**Cognitive Diversity:**
- CI range: 98-156
- Various attention levels (1-5)
- Different processing speeds (1-5)
- Mixed memory capabilities (3-5)

**Behavioral Diversity:**
- Emotional regulation: 2-4
- Impulsivity: 1-5
- Activity levels: 1-4
- Social skills: 2-4

**Learning Style Diversity:**
- Channels: Auditory, Visual, Kinesthetic, Mixed
- Grouping: Individual, Pair, Small group
- Movement: Some need movement, most don't

## Key Student Profiles in Pilot Classroom

### Double Exceptionality Students (3)

- **Estudiante_93:** Balanced high performer (3-5), visual learner, high CI (130)
- **Estudiante_94:** Math strength (5), writing challenge (2), high CI (136)

### Low Performers - Intervention Focus (5)
- **Estudiante_26:** Consistent level 2-3, needs time and collaboration
- **Estudiante_7:** Reading struggles (1), auditory learner, needs immediate feedback
- **Estudiante_6:** Balanced low performer, responds to recognition
- **Estudiante_15:** Reading struggles, visual learner, needs variety
- **Estudiante_12:** Consistent challenges, auditory learner, needs novelty

### Mid Performers - Core Group (11)
Range from students with specific subject challenges to those approaching high performance:
- **Estudiante_17:** Attention challenges (ADHD-like profile)
- **Estudiante_11:** Steady performer with processing speed issues
- **Estudiante_5:** Kinesthetic learner needing movement
